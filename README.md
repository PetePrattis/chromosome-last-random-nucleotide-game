# A Python Program / Project

**This is a Python project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the sixth semester class Bioinformatics
and is one of the final projects for the class_

> #### Description of project
>
>>A Python script that implements a two player strategic game with two sequences of length n and m nucleotides respectively. At each Round of the game a player can remove a random number of nucleotides from one sequence or the same number of nucleotides from both sequences. The player who removes the last nucleotide wins.


> #### Strategy explanation
>
>A player, in order to be able to win the game described in this exercise, must find himself in 2 cases:
> 1. Case 1
>>Equal length on both chromosomes.
> 2. Case 2
>>At least one chromosome shall have a length of 0.
>Therefore, every time we play, we try to find ourselves in the above situations in order to defeat our opponent.
